- Improve error messages when auto-parsing through SingleTarget
- Make sure that all given arguments are 'assigned' before parsing them
- Or validate them?
- Disallow passing positional arguments between option arguments?
  (so that giving a flag an argument won't result in an unintended positional)
  (example: running 'kor translate -l wl.txt ark.txt' where... oh heck, that's still valid )
